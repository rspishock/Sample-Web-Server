# Home Servers

### Description
This repo contains Chef recipes and terraform files for the provisioning, configuration, and deployment of a simple web server setup.

The initial implementation of this setup will be in a local environment, setting up the servers in a virtual environment.  Once I have verified that the Chef recipes are working as intended, I will begin working on the Terraform files to provision the hosts to GCP 

This will include two Linux web servers and a single Linux load balancer.

#### Future
I may include Chef recipes and Terraform files for redundant database servers.
